# React-useState-practice
This was just a practice repository in order to help me understand use-state hooks a little better. It seems like GitHub deleted my seccond commit 
because there were too many json packages??? Never heard of anything like that being the reason for deleting someones commit. So anyway the full practice code/repo 
isn't on here since the second commit was deleted by GitHub. I will have to get around to fixing it later on when I get a break from schoolwork @ KingAnyway, I just want to thank you for looking at my repository, & God Bless!!!
